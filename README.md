# LinkedList-DataStructure
This program helps to understans Linked List Datastructure.
I've created 3 files  :
1. Node. java : Contains two fields for L.List (data & next node).
2. Runner.java : Main class for L.List
3. LinkedList.java: Our own linked list. I've given comment for each line for better understanding and explain how l.list works internally.
